          About Me

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Hello! I&apos;m David, a passionate developer based in Portugal. I
          enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be
          websites, applications, or anything in between.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          My interest in web development started back in 2015 when I decided to
          try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom
          reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Fast-forward to today, and I&apos;ve had the privilege of working at a
          start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main
          focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and
          digital experiences.
