          Hello! I&apos;m David, a developer based in Portugal with a background
          in computer science, cloud engineering, and immersive technologies. I
          enjoy building reliable and scalable digital solutions, from web
          applications to cloud-based systems.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          My journey into development began in 2010 during my computer science
          degree, where I started experimenting with software projects and later
          expanded into areas such as mobile development, virtual reality, and
          cloud computing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Today, I run my own company as a Full Stack Web Developer, helping
          clients turn ideas into practical, well-engineered web solutions with
          a strong focus on performance, usability, and maintainability.
